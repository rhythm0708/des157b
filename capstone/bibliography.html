            <li>Reese, Hope. 2022. “What Happens When Police Use AI to Predict and Prevent Crime?” JSTOR Daily. February 23, 2022. <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/what-happens-when-police-use-ai-to-predict-and-prevent-crime/">https://daily.jstor.org/what-happens-when-police-use-ai-to-predict-and-prevent-crime/</a>.
                <p>The article describes a use case for AI in policing, where machine learning algorithms can be used to anticipate and theoretically prevent crime before it occurs. However, the data being used to train these algorithms contain historical bias and may perpetuate inequalities. In current applications, it helps police departments identify “high-risk” communities which in turn leads to more crime being ‘identified’ in those areas, thus creating a negative reinforcing feedback loop. Historically, studies have shown that these systems are inaccurate and lead to significant, coercive action taking place on innocent suspects. Researchers from Columbia University, in tandem with the AI Now Institute and the New York University School of Law’s Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have also begun to examine the use of AI algorithms in courtroom litigation. They worry that “as AI systems rely more on deep learning, potentially becoming more autonomous and inscrutable, the accountability gap for constitutional violations threatens to become broader and deeper.” One key question that arises is: How should we hold software companies accountable? Should tech companies assume responsibility?</p>

November 15, 2023. <a href="https://communicationmgmt.usc.edu/blog/ai-in-hr-how-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-hiring">https://communicationmgmt.usc.edu/blog/ai-in-hr-how-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-hiring</a>.
            
                <p>This article by USC finds that 55% of companies are investing in automated recruiting measures that use AI. Some of the core improvements being made to the recruiting process are: reduction of personal bias in recruiting, increased application-scanning speed, and faster identification of candidates who fulfill competency requirements through keyword scanning. The article also observes that AI undeniably changes the recruiting process: resumes are valued lower, the role of human resources shrinks, and there will be a rejuvenated focus on AI policies in hiring and recruiting. The article seems to take a neutral stance: not being strictly pro- or anti-AI. It is worth noting that this article was written in support of USC’s Communications programs.</p>

                <p>The article describes how AI has been deployed in HireVue’s “Hiring Intelligence Program” and in AS Tracking in a U.K. school. AI allows hiring to be conducted at an accelerated rate and harnesses machine learning to evaluate the facial expressions, tones, and language of applicants to compare them against model employees. In schools, although AI tracking has led to a 20% reduction in pupil self-harm, critics worry that schools will eventually apply it to other areas due to “mission creep.” Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, worries that it could eventually be used to rank students, sort them into classrooms, or decide who gets to go to university. AI-based employee monitoring is currently being used by over 50% of companies that bring in over $750M in annual revenue. When AI is shown to lead to improved results, economic imperatives indicate that AI-based classification systems will be adopted more and more, leading to more ingrained biases and unjust social structures.</p>

                <p>This article highlights how AI is being used to address the waste crisis by streamlining the sorting process and reducing the manual labor required. Using robotics and AI-trained computer vision, EverestLabs’ RecycleOS can sort objects with >95% accuracy. It is trained on a proprietary dataset of over 5 billion recyclable objects, allowing it to provide accurate data on the shape, size, weight, material, packaging, commodity value, and brand of recyclables flowing through the plant. This system has helped Alameda County Industries (ACI) reduce its labor costs by 59% in three years by picking up approximately 30 million objects. They helped another customer quantify a 900k annual revenue opportunity by identifying the value of recyclables being incorrectly sent to landfills. Another important impact is the ability to measure progress across recyclers, brands, and policymakers in reaching the US National Recycling Goal of 50% by 2030.</p>

                <p>In 2025, an alarming number of people are turning towards AI for therapy and mental health applications, signalling a broad cultural shift in how AI chatbots are being used. A global shortage of therapists and a surge in people struggling with mental health has created a gap that AI chatbots can fill with cheap-to-free mental health assistance. Early research has shown that these chatbots can be effective at reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. However, researchers admit that more research needs to be done before they can recommend it as an alternative. Benefits of AI therapy chatbots are 24-7 availability, no wait times, customizability, and non-judgmental treatments. Drawbacks include risk of giving false or harmful guidance, privacy and accountability concerns, and lack of real human empathy.</p>
