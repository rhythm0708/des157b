        <h2>Example 1: FutureTimeline.net</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/">A timeline of future predictions year-by-year, decade-by-decade.</a></p>

        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li>I like how the 21st century is segmented into decades (e.g. 2010â€“2019), whereas the 22nd century (which is further away) is grouped into sets of 50 years.</li>
            <li>The content of each subpage is plain. It's essentially a list of links sorted by year, which provides a lot of information quickly but isn't visually engaging.</li>
            <li>Navigation is logical and UI helps visitors understand where they are in the information architecture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example 2: Earth 2050</h2>
        <p><a href="https://2050.earth/">A speculative website containing short articles and images depicting what people might expect to see in the next few decades</a></p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li>Beautiful artworks that really sell the idea that we're looking at a future earth with limitless possibilities.</li>
            <li>Below-average loading times and buffering.</li>
            <li>Readers can engage with the website by voting on whether or not they think each prediction will come true.</li>
            <li>To vote, readers need to sign up on the website.</li>
            <li>Futuristic vibe conveyed through a vibrant color scheme</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example 3: Scenarios Unfold: What If AI Controlled Everything? (Video)</h2>

        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li>Especially towards the beginning, the writing is too sarcastic to be taken seriously.</li>
            <li>Content is slightly out-of-date. It still deals with generative AI but AI chatbots have grown so much since then and developed new behaviors that haven't been covered (e.g. glazing).</li>
            <li>Story is mildly engaging, but it takes too long to get to the point.</li>
        </ul>
