        <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
        <p class="italics">What if AI was...?</p>
        <p>For my capstone, I plan to create an interactive 'What if?' experience that explores the unintended consequences of AI. My intended scope is three minisodes. Each minisode should illustrate the unforeseen consequences of AI when applied to different cases, such as a news delivery platform.</p>
        <p>I chose this project because it's a low-stakes challenge that can be scaled based on my time availability. It's a departure from the game and JS-heavy projects that I've been creating in DES 157A and 157B. It also touches upon a meaningful and culturally relevant topic that relates to our collective future.</p>
        <p>My topic relates to challenging mental models and data visualization. To succeed, I will need to understand current people's mental models and the changed mental model that I hope to inspire. I plan to use frameworks to develop this insight—the Ladder of Inference seems particularly helpful here. In addition, I need to present my data and arguments in a visually compelling narrative. This is one of the skills that I hope to develop through doing this project.</p>
        <p>Some features I imagine my project would include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Animate on Scroll (AOS)</li>
            <li>Live Data Visualization</li>
            <li>Simple Cartoon Graphics</li>
            <li>Everything on one page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some potential scenarios for my project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI as a therapy bot</li>
            <li>AI in the manual workplace</li>
            <li>AI in policing</li>
            <li>AI in hiring</li>
            <li>AI as a content or news bot</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm wondering if there should be an interactive element in my project—points where users have to click to 'react' to the narrative presented on-screen or make a decision. I'm not certain whether this will appropriate for my project, but I think this will become more apparent as I test variations and begin fleshing out the writing.</p>
